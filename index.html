	  <h3>Career</h3>

		<p>In March 2010, Suzy joined fellow members Fei, and Jia to form the group miss A. The trio began their first official promotional activities in China as a group by signing up with the Samsung Electronics group in China. The group released a song used for the commercial called "Love Again" for the Samsung Beat Festival. The song was written by Korean composer Super Changddai, and the music video was directed by Hong Won-ki.[6][7] The group was later joined by a fourth member, Min. The four piece girl group eventually made their debut in July 2010 through JYP Entertainment, with the single "Bad Girl Good Girl"[8] After a successful promotion period of seven weeks, the group came back in October with a new title track, "Breathe", from the second single Step Up. They promoted the song for a month and had their last goodbye stage on November 7. The group then returned in July 2011 with the release of their first full-length studio album A Class with the title track "Good Bye Baby". The group held their goodbye stage in early September after finding great success with their album and title track. They then turned their focus towards their overseas activities, including their Chinese debut. In February 2012, they came back with their new style of music through Touch. In the later quarter of the year 2012, they released Independent Women Pt.III. The album was designed to pay homage to the song "Independent Women" by Destiny's Child, the group's idol. On November 6, 2013, miss A made their comeback after more than a year with a second full-length studio album Hush. The title track was composed by famous composer duo, E-Tribe. On March 30, 2015, the group released another chart topping hit song titled "Only You" produced by Black Eyed Pilseung from their mini album Colors</p>

		 <h3>Personal Life</h3>

		<p>

		In March 2015, Suzy and South Korean actor and singer Lee Min-ho were confirmed to be in a relationship.[34]

		In 2016, an Indian criminal group was arrested and among the various items stolen, Suzy's personal information and image were found inside of a bankbook. The women in possession of the book claimed that she created the fake identity after downloading Suzy's picture off of the internet.[35] Her representing company, JYP Entertainment, reasoned that the theft occurred because of her status as a well-known celebrity.
